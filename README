Some basic instructions:


To get the rcparams in floris_plot_lib to work properly you need to do the following:

1. install matplotlib 1.0+
    If, for some reason, you need v0.99, then you can still install v1.0+ in a virtual environment, and then do something like:
        import sys
        sys.path.insert(0, '/home/floris/MPL1/lib/python2.6/site-packages/')
        
2. install latex:
    sudo apt-get install texlive
    sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extras
    sudo apt-get install ghostscript
    
    
if you encounter errors or trouble, please let me know.
